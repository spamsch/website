Clean Core — with both feet on the ground


SAP’s Clean Core is a strong direction, and the new extensibility framework makes it more tangible. But the principle itself isn’t new.


I’ve led many SAP projects over the years where I already applied the soul of Clean Core — long before it had a name. Do you remember DIAG, Dynpro and RFCs over TCP? Side-by-side applications hosted in Sankt Leon-Rot or Walldorf on Linux machines? Clean Core was already possible then but much harder to achieve.


I minimized coupling, favored released APIs, and treated modification governance as architecture work, not hygiene.


That experience shapes how I view the current Clean Core maturity path.


SAP’s updated framing


The new SAP Clean Core model introduces four extensibility levels (A–D).


It replaces the binary “clean vs. not clean” rhetoric with something usable for real landscapes.


  •  Level A – Fully clean: ABAP Cloud, side-by-side CAP or Build solutions using released APIs and events.

  •  Level B – Controlled classic: released BAdIs, exits, or public interfaces where Cloud APIs are not yet available.

  •  Level C – Conditional: selective internal use with documentation and change tracking.

  •  Level D – Non-compliant: direct modifications or implicit enhancements, to be phased out.


This structure acknowledges that real systems evolve, and architects need controlled flexibility.


My pragmatic playbook


Clean Core breaks down not through intent but through unmanaged exceptions.


A working strategy aligns architectural discipline with SAP’s four-level model:


  1.  Inventory and classify

Score each custom artifact for coupling, business value, and technical risk.

Map to Level A–D using SAP’s released API catalog.

  2.  Modularize intelligently

Move business extensions outward via CAP or BTP (Level A).

Keep performance-critical logic inside via ABAP Cloud (still Level A).

Never let latency justify unsafe internals.

  3.  Enforce guardrails

ATC checks, an internal extension registry, and changelog tracking are mandatory—especially for Level C.

  4.  Remediate continuously

After each upgrade or patch, rescan and push artifacts upward toward Level A or B.


Field example


  •  Pricing routine: remains in-core via a released Cloud BAdI, unit-tested and monitored.

  •  Monthly aggregation: offloaded to CAP on BTP, exposed via OData, executed off-core.

  •  No public API? Wrap the internal call with a façade, log an influence request, and track it as temporary Level C debt.


Closing stance


Treat Clean Core as a maturity journey, not a checkbox. The updated model formalizes what disciplined teams have practiced for years: deliberate extension, controlled coupling, and measurable cleanliness.
