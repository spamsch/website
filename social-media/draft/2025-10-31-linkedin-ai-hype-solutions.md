AI Hype is real; but solutions are too

There’s a lot of AI hype and so many tools that promise to magically solve your problems. But many pilots don’t reach ROI. A recent study by the MIT found that only 5% of started AI initiatives made it into production.

But real wins exist — if you design for them: fix the workflow first, keep AI small and late in the flow, measure cost per successful outcome (CPSO), and keep a human in the loop. Start with small initiatives. Grow your AI footprint only when you see positive ROI.

+ What works now (pragmatic, repeatable)

- Knowledge‑heavy support where retrieval covers 90% and response templates handle the rest.
- Analyst copilots that propose but never auto‑commit (humans approve diffs).
- Document assembly from templates + retrieval (policy letters, contracts) with human sign‑off.
- CRM assist: summarize calls, draft follow‑ups, update fields — humans press send.
- Marketing support: analyze markets, sentiment and customer voices, draft strategies and content
- Customer analytics: summarize interactions, extract signals, draft solutions

+ How to get value

• Baseline first: ask “Do we need AI at all?” Fix with rules, UX/forms, search, RPA, and cleaner data. If this clears 70–80%, stop.
• Where AI fits: targeted edges — summaries/drafts, retrieval Q&A over your docs, tagging/routing, structured extraction, or bounded tool calls.
• Solution order, not sequence: AI comes last on the solution sheet, after non‑AI avenues. When used, keep it at the edge (draft/propose) with human review before commit.
• Ship gates: prefer small models + retrieval; smallest context + caching; track CPSO vs. baseline and ship only if cheaper at equal or higher quality.

+ Who you need (and don’t)

Skip the slideware. Don't listen to the big four giving you FOMO. Bring architects and technologists who ship: integrate systems, clean data, add guardrails, and place AI at the edge — not the center. Most challenges have an engineering solution where the AI part is last, not first.

+ The outlook

Done right, projects I see steady 10–20% gains on well‑scoped tasks. Fewer tools, more discipline. Less AI, more intelligence.
