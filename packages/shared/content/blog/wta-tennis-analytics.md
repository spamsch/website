The WTA needed more than box scores—they needed a platform that turns raw match telemetry into stories coaches can act on and fans want to follow. I designed and delivered the cloud architecture, data governance, and product roadmap that made Tennis Analytics the heartbeat of their tour coverage.

## Engineering the Pipeline

- **Configurable loaders.** I built ingestion services that harvest live and historical data from WTA web services, orchestrate persistence, and scale across SAP HANA and Microsoft SQL Server depending on workload demands.
- **Transformation layer.** Match telemetry flows through resilient pipelines that enrich every encounter with head-to-head history, seasonal momentum, and performance indices, generating the player dossiers powering match notes.
- **Unified interfaces.** APIs and reporting channels broadcast real-time match state, breakpoint analysis, double-fault tracking, and more—so web, mobile, broadcast, and internal tools consume the same authoritative logic.

## Predictive Intelligence

I layered probabilistic modelling on top of the telemetry so we could project Finals qualification scenarios. Future schedules, points at stake, and player form feed interactive leaderboards like the Race to Shenzhen, giving media teams and fans a dynamic view of what’s at stake.

## Why It Matters On and Off Court

Coaching staffs plan with confidence because they see the same insights fans do. Commentators get data-backed narratives mid-match. Supporters stay glued to evolving leaderboards instead of waiting for end-of-day recaps. In a sport where momentum swings fast, Tennis Analytics keeps everyone—from players to viewers—moving in sync.

## Leading the Delivery

I coordinated engineers, designers, and WTA stakeholders through short feedback loops, transparent documentation, and data-quality sign-offs before every release. That cadence turned a wish list into a production system that continuously publishes trustworthy content and fuels fan engagement.

Great tennis deserves great data. This platform proves you can honour the sport’s rhythm while amplifying the stories that keep audiences coming back.
