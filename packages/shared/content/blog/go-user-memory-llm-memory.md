Most LLM products plateau once conversations span days or departments. Context windows burst, graph stores drift, and costs spike. This project set out to solve that by becoming the cognition layer every AI assistant wishes it had. I led the architecture, research, and implementation from zero to investor-ready.

## What We Set Out to Build

- **Persistent memory** that remembers decisions, sentiment, and commitments without drowning the model in tokens.
- **Trustworthy retrieval** so every answer comes with an evidence trail your compliance team can audit.
- **Lean operations** that a startup can run on day one and scale with customers without rewriting the core.

## Architecture Pillars

1. **Hybrid retrieval.** I paired lexical GIN indexes with ANN vector search and structured predicate catalogs. That combination delivers business breadth (millions of snippets) without graph latency.

2. **Signal intelligence.** I designed LLM-driven extraction pipelines to capture loyalty signals, risk flags, and intent—stored as typed facts with provenance so downstream agents can reason over them.

3. **Context optimisation loop.** I implemented alternative query generation, cosine re-ranking, and chunk window tuning to keep prompts slim while preserving relevance for GPT-4o/5-series models.

4. **Workflow automation.** I built workers that ingest data, enforce quotas, batch embeddings, and sync spaces. Deploying to Cloudflare Workers kept latency low and costs transparent.

## Delivery in Practice

- **Specification-first.** Every API, job, and handler I shipped came with type hints, formatting constraints, and pytest coverage so the team can scale safely.
- **90-day go-to-market plan.** I kept architecture, product milestones, and fundraising targets in a single roadmap that aligned founders, design partners, and investors.
- **Competitive validation.** I benchmarked Supermemory, Mem0, and Zep to back my choices with research—not hype.

## Result

LLM Memory isn’t just a feature; it’s the backbone that lets AI assistants stay coherent over time. By combining rigorous retrieval science with pragmatic engineering, I built a memory fabric enterprises can trust and startups can actually ship.
