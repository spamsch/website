Deploying LLMs in production is fundamentally different from running them in notebooks. Here's what I've learned shipping AI-powered systems that handle real user traffic and business-critical workflows.

## The Production Reality

Moving from prototype to production means dealing with:
- **Latency requirements** under real user load
- **Cost constraints** at scale
- **Safety and reliability** concerns
- **Model drift** and performance degradation

## Building Robust LLM Pipelines

### 1. Context and Retrieval Strategy

Your model is only as good as the context you provide:
- Implement hybrid retrieval (vector + keyword search)
- Use semantic chunking strategies
- Monitor context relevance and update retrieval logic
- Cache frequent queries to reduce costs

### 2. Guardrails and Safety

Production LLMs need multiple layers of protection:
- **Input sanitization** to prevent prompt injection
- **Output filtering** for inappropriate content
- **Rate limiting** per user and globally
- **Fallback mechanisms** when models fail

### 3. Monitoring and Observability

Track everything that matters:
- Response latency and throughput
- Model confidence scores
- User satisfaction metrics
- Cost per request
- Failure rates and error types

## Cost Optimization Strategies

LLM costs can spiral quickly. Here's how to keep them under control:

1. **Smart caching** - Cache responses for common queries
2. **Model routing** - Use smaller models for simple tasks
3. **Batch processing** - Group non-urgent requests
4. **Context optimization** - Minimize token usage without losing quality

## Real-World Example: Go User Memory

In building Go User Memory's hybrid retrieval fabric, we implemented:
- **Multi-stage retrieval** to reduce context size
- **Confidence thresholding** to trigger human handoff
- **A/B testing infrastructure** for prompt optimization
- **Cost tracking** down to individual user interactions

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with safety** - It's harder to add guardrails later
2. **Monitor user experience** - Technical metrics don't tell the whole story
3. **Plan for scale** - LLM costs grow faster than traditional software
4. **Embrace iteration** - Model performance improves with production data

The gap between demo and production-ready LLM systems is significant, but with the right architecture and monitoring, you can build AI experiences that users trust and businesses can rely on.
